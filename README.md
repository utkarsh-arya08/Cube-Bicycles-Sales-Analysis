# Cube-Bicycles-Sales-Analysis
### Project Overview:
The Cube Cycles Sales Report Dashboard project aims to provide a holistic view of the company's sales performance through a dynamic and interactive dashboard. The dashboard consolidates data from various sources, integrating key dimensions such as sales territory, order dates, and customer information. Using Power Pivot for data modelling, the dashboard allows users to seamlessly analyze and filter data across multiple time frames—monthly, quarterly, and yearly—while providing insights into region-specific and customer-specific profitability. The visualizations are designed to enable stakeholders to quickly grasp total sales, profit margins, and product costs, thereby facilitating data-driven decision-making.

### Objective:
* The objective of this project is to create a comprehensive sales report dashboard that empowers Cube Cycles to:
* Monitor Sales Performance: Track total sales and profits across different periods (monthly, quarterly, yearly) to identify trends and performance benchmarks.
* Analyze Profitability: Evaluate region-wise and customer-specific profitability to uncover insights that can drive targeted marketing and sales strategies.
* Enhance Data Accessibility: Use dynamic filtering and in-depth data analysis to make detailed sales and profitability information easily accessible to stakeholders.
* Support Decision-Making: Provide a visual and data-driven foundation for strategic decisions, helping the company optimize its sales and marketing efforts.
